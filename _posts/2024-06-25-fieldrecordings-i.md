Originally made for the 'Mixed Media Documentary' course at HKU. With the focus on sound, I wanted to tell a story. Although I wasn't able to tell that much here, it did produce nice results, and a basis to further expand upon. 

In the recordings, I use a combination of LOM BasicUchos, and Aquarian H2d microphones, in combination with a MixPre-6 II or Zoom H4n.
