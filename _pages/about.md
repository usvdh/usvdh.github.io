Sen van der Heide is a student of Image & Media Technology at the Utrecht School of the Arts. He has a strong background in technology, both in software and hardware. He enjoys working with sound and image and is interested in creating connections between the physical and digital worlds. The viewer is engaged with the work through interactivity and immersion. He often starts with a simple concept or idea and develops it extensively. The themes of his works often stem from his own fascinations and interests.
